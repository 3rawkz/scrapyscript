*Scrapy Script*

Minimalist interface for Scrapy, Python's favorite web scraping framework.

Scrapyscript (SS) allows you to invoke one or more spiders from a script, have them all run in parallel, and get the results back as a single list.  No scrapy project, no boilerplate, no hassle.

**Examples**
Let's create a spider that retrieves every link on www.python.org.

``` python
from scrapyscript import Job, Processor
from scrapy.spiders import Spider

class PythonSpider(Spider):
    name = 'myspider'
    start_urls = ['http://www.python.org']
